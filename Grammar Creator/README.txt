NLP HW 2


	Q5

Runtime: 103 seconds
Precision: 0.714
Recall: 0.714
F Score: = 0.714

Observations: I noticed that for S, my precision, recall, and f1score were 0.626, 0.782, and 0.695 respectively.
It is interesting that the tagger does not really know if a group of words is a sentence or not, and makes me think
that this form of AI is not very "intelligent".

	Q6 

Runtime: 128 seconds
Precision: 0.742
Recall: 0.742
F Score: 0.742

Observations: Here the precision, fscore, and recall were 0.704, 0.814, and 0.755. I think this shows that vertical
markovization makes this model more "intelligent".
